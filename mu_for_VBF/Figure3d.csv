#: name: Figure 3d
#: description: The observed $m_{T}$ and $m_{jj}$ distributions in the ejj (upper left), $\mu$~jj (upper right), $\tau_{h}$~jj (lower left), and $0\ell$~jj (lower right) signal regions compared with the post-fit SM background yields from the fit described in the text. The pre-fit background yields and shapes are determined using data-driven methods for the major backgrounds, and based on simulation for the smaller backgrounds. Expected signal distributions are overlaid. The last bin in the $m_{T}$ distributions of the $1\ell$~jj channels include all events with $m_{T} > 210$~GeV. The last bin of the $m_{jj}$ distributions of the $0\ell$~jj channel include all events with $m_{jj} > 3800$~GeV.
